1 . SSH into the server

SSH into the server running your HTTP website as a user with sudo privileges.

2 . Install snapd

No Ubuntu 20.04 já vem

Acessar o servidor onde deseja instalar o certbot

You'll need to install snapd and make sure you follow any instructions to enable classic snap support.
Follow these instructions on snapcraft's site to install snapd. 

3 . Garantir que tem a última versão do snap
Este não vem no 20.04

sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core

4 . Remover qualquer pacote do CertBot

sudo apt-get remove certbot

5 . Install Certbot

Run this command on the command line on the machine to install Certbot.

sudo snap install --classic certbot

6 . Prepare the Certbot command

Execute the following instruction on the command line on the machine to ensure that the certbot command can be run.

sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

7 . Choose how you'd like to run Certbot

    Either get and install your certificates...

    Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration automatically to serve it, turning on HTTPS access in a single step.

    sudo certbot --nginx

    Or, just get a certificate

    If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your Nginx configuration by hand, run this command.

    sudo certbot certonly --nginx

8 .  Test automatic renewal

The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job or systemd timer that will renew your certificates automatically before they expire. You will not need to run Certbot again, unless you change your configuration. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:

sudo certbot renew --dry-run

The command to renew certbot is installed in one of the following locations:

    /etc/crontab/
    /etc/cron.*/*
    systemctl list-timers
