# readline

Suporte somente para unix

// Input section 
// $a = 10 
$a = (int)readline('Enter an integer: '); 
  
// $b = 9.78 
$b = (float)readline('Enter a floating point number: '); 
  
// Entered integer is 10 and 
// entered float is 9.78 
echo "Entered integer is " . $a 
    . " and entered float is " . $b;

#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
$user = readline("Limpar a tela? [limpar] | Sair [s]: ");

if ($user === "limpar"){ system("clear"); }

if ($user === "s"){ exit; }

echo "\nValeu!\n";

Since PHP has a built-in unix only function readline() to do exactly that, here leaving the following notes.

We can use and hold the result of readline into a var.

#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
$user = readline("List dir [l] | Say hello [h] | exit [q]: ");

if ($user === "l"){ system("ls"); }

if ($user === "h"){ echo "Hello!"; }

if ($user === "q"){ exit; }

echo "\nThanks!";

Example output:

l ls result

h «hello»

q exit

ctrl+c exit.

ctrl+d with empty input, continue to the next sequence. «Thanks». $user is defined and empty, no error.

ctrl+d with some input: No action. Still waiting for input.

ctrl+m Continue and take the current input in $user.

ctrl+j Continue and take the current input in $user, same behavior as ctrl+m.

Return continue to the next sequence «Thanks». $user can stay empty, no error.

ctrl+z may be used to cancel a loop and move to the top one. $user will be unset if the var is not defined in this scope.

Depending input, we can define empty values using!empty or do more surgical testings (the readline response can be many chars).

$user can be tested with !isset if not yet asked.

There is also the built-in readline_add_history() to store the user input into an object, where values can be retrieved directly by their name (Nice for code clarity):

readline_add_history($user);
print_r(readline_list_history());
print_r(readline_user());

Very useful to build real complex stuffs!
