JSX?
Writing JavaScript/React code to describe what the user interface (UI) will look like is not as simple as you may think. This makes the React author create what looks like a JavaScript version of HTML. This is called JSX (JavaScript XML). It is an XML like syntax extension to JavaScript that makes it easier and more intuitive to describe the UI.

Under the hood, the JSX is being translated to regular JavaScript version of itself at runtime since the browser can’t read it.

    • You can use a valid JavaScript expression inside the JSX through curly braces, {}.
    • In JSX, elements attributes, event handlers are always in camelCase. The few exceptions are aria-* and data-* attributes, which are lowercase.
