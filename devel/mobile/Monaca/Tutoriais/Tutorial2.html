Monaca Debugger is a powerful application for testing and debugging your Monaca applications on real devices in real time.
When developing Monaca apps on your local PC, assuming that the local PC is successfully paired with the Monaca Debugger, all changes made to the project files will be pushed into Monaca Debugger as soon as you save those changes.

Step 1: Pairing the Monaca Debugger with a local PC
To debug or test a local Monaca app, you need to pair your PC with the Monaca Debugger.
Before connecting the Monaca Debugger to a PC, please pay attention to the following points:
Monaca Debugger and the PC have to be connected to the same network connection (LAN or Wi-Fi).
Use the same Monaca account for both Monaca Debugger and the PC.

    Disable the PC’s firewall.

In the terminal window, navigate to your project folder and run the  command to connect to the Monaca Debugger. Then, the Monaca CLI will wait for the requests from the debugger.

. Launch the Monaca Debugger app and sign in using your Monaca account information. Make sure you are using the same account information as for the Monaca CLI.

. A popup message asking you to pair the debugger with the PC will appear.

4. If the pairing is successful, your local project name will appear under Local Projects in the Monaca Debugger. However, if the pairing does not work, refer to 

Step 2: Running a project on the Monaca Debugger
From the local projects list in the Monaca Debugger, click on a project name to run it.
Now the project should be running as shown in the screenshot below. Touch the back button in the debugger menu to go back to the project list screen.
